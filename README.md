# CAHSRA Public Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This honors project analyzes public sentiment toward the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CAHSRA) by collecting and processing social media data from Reddit and YouTube. Using natural language processing techniques and visualization tools, the dashboard provides real-time insights into how people perceive CAHSR’s funding, governance, construction progress, and overall public image.

## 🛠 Run Locally (For Developers or Contributors)

If you want to run the dashboard locally on your own machine (for development or offline use), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cahsra-sentiment-dashboard.git
   cd cahsra-sentiment-dashboard
   ```

2. **Set up your Azure secrets**  
   This app uses Azure Blob Storage to read sentiment data. To run the dashboard locally, you will need:
   - An Azure Storage account
   - A container named `visualizationdata`
   - CSV files structured as described below (see “Azure Blob Structure”)

   Then create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file and insert your connection string:

   ```toml
   [default]
   AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING = "your_connection_string_here"
   ```
   ⚠️ *Note: If you don’t have access to the original data files, the dashboard won’t work as expected.*

3. **Install dependencies**  
   The `requirements.txt` file lists all necessary Python packages. Install them with:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch the dashboard locally**

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
   ```
